    "text": "Abstract\nResearch shows that for incarcerated people skin hue can have an effect on how long their sentencing is. This study dives into the possible biases concerning skin hue and punishment of a Hispanic man. Differences in Skin Hue among the Hispanic population have a large range of shades. Biases against darker shades of skin can lead to longer and harsher incarceration sentences. The biases of skin hue within an ethnicity is known as colorism. Using photoshop 72 participants are told a man committed armed robbery and then shown either a light-skinned mugshot or a dark-skinned mugshot and asked to sentence the man. With a large Hispanic sample population, colorism was tested and there was no significant difference on sentence length of both mugshots. This shows that in the population used there was no significant colorism against the dark-skinned mug shot and no significant favoritism to the light-skinned mugshot. This is a pilot study that with further testing could help shed light on different ethnicities biases in colorism.\n\n\nReferences"

    "text": "Literature Review\nSkin Hue and Punishment, the title of this project, came from hours of researching incarceration rates and prison sentence lengths as they relate to race and skin hue. Observations of the varying skin hues in my own family lead me to wonder if undergraduates view skin color and punishment vary within the Hispanic community. Gyimah-Brempong et al. describe the Mississippi prison population and bring to light how Black prisoners have the longest sentences when compared to other race and/or ethnicities. This article also reports on the effect of colorism within the same race by comparing the longer sentences of darker skinned Black Americans compared to lighter skinned Black Americans (Gyimah-Brempong et al, 2006). \nIt should be noted that Hispanics are classified as an ethnicity in the United States, not as a race. Nevertheless, it is the community and focus for this experiment. the Hispanic and the Latino community overlap for most countries and are used interchangeably in many articles. For proposes of his paper and experiment I am using Hispanic (self-identifying) as the community I am researching, but many of the articles will also be about the Latino community. Within these articles sometimes Latino is also represented as Latina, Latino/a, or Latinx. \nIt should be noted that Hispanic is classified as an ethnicity in the United States, not a race, nonetheless, it is the community this experiment focuses on. Hispanic is the ethnicity I've chosen for my research; however, the Hispanic community and the Latino community overlap for most countries and are used interchangeably in many articles. For the sake of his paper and experiment I am using Hispanic as the community I am researching, but many of the articles will also be about the Latino community. Within these articles sometimes Latino is also represented as Latina, Latino/a, or Latinx. \nA study on incarceration rates and sentence lengths in Georgia found that Black Americans regardless of the crime (Burch, 2015). The researchers also found that within the Black American prison population the men with lighter skin had shorter sentences than the men with darker skin. Although skin color correlated with sentencing lengths, Black Americans, even the light skinned ones, tended to have longer sentences than White Americans for the same crime. \nDixon and Tells in 2017 chronicle that the differences in the skin color as understood in Latin America. According to their article in Latin America, where the Hispanic ethnicity originates from, is a mix of indigenous, Spanish, Portuguese and Black communities. Spanish and Portuguese can both trace their ancestry to inhabitants of Iberia from the XX century. In Mexico the word \"mextizaje\" means mixed-person—or what they would refer to as the Mexican race. Even with this mixed-person idea as the Mexican race, studies show that those with darker skin have lower socio-economic status and face more discrimination than those that are lighter skin in the United States. This is evident in Georgia where Mexicans with darker skin face a harder time with income, health, and discrimination (Dixon and Tells, 2017, p.33.5). \nColorism differs from racism because it only is about the color of skin and not the race or ethnic background of the person. Colorism has to do with prejudices due to the color of someone's skin, and racism has to do with prejudices due to the race of a person. Colorism is an English-Speaking term and not widely used in Latin America (Dixon and Tells, 2017, p.33.9). Because this experiment is being done at Fresno Pacific University, in the United States, colorism is the concept used, but \"Skin Hue\" is the term this article will be using. Barlow and Sibley write about how, within a specific group of people there can be biases against those that fit more stereotypical features for their group. An example they use is a black man who has a wide nose, very dark skin, and big lips fit the stereotypes of a black man more than a black man that has lighter skin tone, slim nose, and thin lips. For Hispanics medium or dark brown skin, dark hair, and brown eyes would fit stereotypical biases.\nResearch from Barlow and Sibley also suggest that the Justice System in the United States is biased against minorities at every level. This includes discrimination beginning at a person's arrest, continuing with their trial, and ending with their sentencing. Mock jurors were used to study biases of real juries in a laboratory like setting. Race and other demographics can be manipulated to isolate discriminating biases. Barlow et al. study found that mock jurors were more likely to find the Black subjects as guilty and issued harsher sentences when compared to White subjects. This mirrors what is found in actual courtrooms and trials. The most disappointing research shows that the death penalty is also skewed against the Black community. Mixed with evidence that Blacks are more wrongly convicted that Whites, the death penalty rates for Black are disturbing.\nDixon and Tells continues on to note that the global industry of skin-bleaching and cosmetic surgery has become more popular in the twentieth century. They attribute this to the rise of white supremacy and the idea of \"new global beauty\". This \"new global beauty\" idea is the look of light skinned, but racially ambiguous that can assume some form of European decent. What does beauty have to do with incarceration and punishment? Qualitive studies will show that people with conventionally attractive features have more opportunities in life. Punishment is a part of life because people commit crimes. In these articles it is clear that a lighter skin tone is associated with less hardships and less prison time."

    "text": "Methods Section\nGiven this background I hypothesize that college students will choose harsher punishment for a dark-skinned Hispanic man compared to a light-skinned Hispanic man. The question came about, how do I measure skin color and skin hue? Burch et al used light, medium, and dark as their measurement, but failed to provide pictures for reference. \nHannon and Defina in 2016 critic the scale as not completely accurate. They arrive at his conclusion by having people see a Latino and then try to identify their skin color using the scale. Most people answered Latino if what they saw fell between the pictures one through four. This experiment altered skin hues with Adobe Photoshop. The NIS Skin Hue scale was used because of its simplicity and because we did not need people to guess the skin tone, just see different skin tones presented for the same crime. There is no need for my participants to guess if the photo is a Latino or a Black man and these critics did not deem worth of dismissing the scale. For my experiment I decided to show participants a story of a crime, a picture of a Hispanic man who did the crime, and then ask them questions about how they would punish the criminal. This does however inspire a follow up question for participants. The follow up questions will be asking participants how dark they thought the picture was on a scale of one to ten.\nChoosing the Hispanic community meant needing to find more articles about the Hispanic and Latino community in prison. Many studies I found when searching about skin color focused on Black Americans and prison sentences verses White Americans and prison sentences. Marrow et al in their article \"Skin Tone and Mexicans' Perceptions of Discrimination in New Immigrant Destinations, 2022, focus on Mexican immigrants and discrimination. \"Whiteness and citizenship affords greater protection to some lighter-skinned Latinos in new destination, while indigenous-origin and non-White or 'Brown' Latinos who 'look Mexican' or 'Hispanic' get left 'at the hands of immigration control'\". In their study 62% of their participants, which was the majority of participants, identified as medium-skinned. This was important in identifying how I should present a representative of a Hispanic man in my experiment.\nWhen trying to find a way to measure biases for skin color I needed to find a crime that did not evoke people to be so angry they would give a harsh sentence no matter what the criminal looked like, or a crime that would evoke people to not care about the crime at all. The United States Sentencing Commission had many facts about crimes and their average incarceration sentences. After looking through many offenses, robbery seemed to be a good middle ground. According to the 2015 fiscal year report 93.5% of robbery offenders were male. This solidified the decision to use a picture of a male in the experiment. The report also mentioned that 15.6% of these robberies were committed by Hispanics. The average sentencing for robbery in 2015 was 111 months (approximately 9.2 years).\nAfter additional research it was decided that using a Hispanic man in my experiment with a medium skin tone, a three to six on the NIS scale, would be best to help me understand the biases of undergraduate students at Fresno Pacific University. Presenting the idea of a robbery would also benefit me when trying to see how harshly a Hispanic man would be punished. There are many studies on the data found in prisons when it comes to race and skin hue, this research hopes to further understand the biases people hold for the men who commit crime based on their skin hue\nPopulation\nA sample population of 72 participants was used for this experiment. Of the participants 42 were Hispanics and 29 were Non-Hispanics. Of the Non-Hispanics there was 1 African, 3 African-Americans, 6 Asians, and 19 White participants. A few of the participants answers were given in non-qualitative form and were not able to be used in the final results. Data collecting was not limited to the psychology lab due to concerns of participant numbers. A variety of candy was purchased from Walmart in hopes of giving participants an incentive to participate. Students on Fresno Pacific University's main campus were approached by the researcher introducing herself, major, and asking them if they'd like to participate in the experiment. Most said yes, but some said no with no reason given, and some said no because they had a test to study for/homework to do. Pens were also provided for the participants to make participating as convenient as possible.\nCrime\nQuick Fact from the United State Sentencing Commission was used to determine that robbery would be used as the crime in the slideshow story. It is a common crime committed as well as most people are familiar with what robbery is. It also gave a general idea of what the average prison sentencing is: 111 months (about 9.25 calendar years).\nSkin Hue\nHannon et al. critique the Massey and Martin's NIS Skin Color Scale, providing different shades of skin color represented in a picture of ten hands. While not pictured, albinism is represented by the number zero. This scale was easy to understand and publicly available for use.\nStudents who agreed to participate were given the consent form and demographics page. Once these were read, signed, and filled out they were asked to flip the demographics page over and use that to write down their answers to the questions on a sideshow. All the slides were plain white background and black text, except for the slide with a picture, that was plain white background and the picture. The plainness of the slideshow was to help the hypothesis by only emphasizes the mug shots as the only photos.\nSlide one was just a plain slide with \"Experiment\" written on it. Slide two gave the story of a crime: \nMr. Hernandez has committed robbery. He walked into a convenience store Saturday night with a gun, pointed it at the 19-year-old cashier and demanded all the cash in the register. There were three other customers in the store at the time. He took the cash but was arrested soon after. In court, camera footage of him was used as evidence and he was convicted. You are the judge; how will you sentence him?\nSlide three was a mugshot. Version 1 was a light-skinned man. Version 2 was a dark-sinned man. Slide four had the following questions:\n\n\"On a scale of 1-10 how bad was this crime? 1 being not bad at all, 10 being very bad.\nBetween 1-20 years, how many years should Mr. Hernandez be face in jail?\" \n\nSlide five was a follow up question hidden until the end for further research on this topic:\n\n“on a scale of 1-10 how dark skinned did you think the mug shot was?\" (see figure 1) \n\nParticipants were given a piece of candy after completing survey, if they didn't complete it they were still given a candy for their time.\nI took three manilla envelopes and labeled them, \"consent forms\", \"1\", and \"2\". After their papers were given back to me, I would mark the back with either a 1 or a 2 depending on which version they completed, and then it was placed in the appropriate manilla envelope. I did not show the 1 or 2 marked envelopes to participants. I created an excel for all my data collection on my MacBook Air that is password protected. After compiling results, a poster board was made for presenting my research in person at Fresno Pacific University's research night and possible further presentation opportunities."

    "text": "Results\nAfter all data was collected, R-Studio was used to run a Two-Way Ancova test for the first two questions, and an independent t-test for the third question. The Two-Way Ancova test results were that was not a significant main effect on the years sentenced of the data that was selected, F(1, 1.4), p = 0.22 (see Figure 2). There was a significant main effect on the participants idea of how bad the crime was related to the years sentenced of the data that was selected, F(1, 22.4), p < 0.001. This second result doesn't affect our hypothesis but does show that participants were consistent with their ideals on the crime and the time sentenced following it. There was no significant interaction effect between the Hispanic and Non-Hispanic populations F(1, 0.02), p = 0.89. See figure 2. It is noted that the United States average is 9.25 years (United States Sentencing Commission) but our participants rated both the mugshots lower than the nation's average. This may also speak to the empathy of Fresno Pacific University's students, or the religious culture that believes in forgiveness.\nWhen testing to see if participants saw a difference in skin hue a t-test was run and there was on average a significant difference on the perception between the dark-skinned mug shot (M=5.07, SE = 0.29), and the light-skinned mug shot (M= 3.84, SE = 0.29). This difference, 1.23, 95% CI[0.59, 0.6] was significant p = 0.004. See figure 3."

    "text": "Discussion\nUnfortunately, the typo in the third slide was not caught until after I had already started administering the experiment and could not change it. Surprisingly enough, no participants pointed out the typo or asked for clarification. The participants not asking for clarification on the typo may be because students at Fresno Pacific University are more kind. Many of the participants that were surveyed were psychology majors and either have completed or will have to complete an experiment start to finish in one semester. The culture of psychology students at Fresno Pacific University is very helpful, tight knit, and supportive.\nThis was a pilot research project, and if retesting is done a much larger sample size would be needed. One of the sampling errors that occurred was that the majority of the participants were Hispanic and did not reflect the population of Fresno Pacific University as a whole. Because there was a very low p-value on the t-test testing to see if participants did see a difference in skin color it can be thought that within the Hispanic community at Fresno Pacific University there is not colorism present for this experiment. This was not the intent of the study but a finding that helps further research at this University. Because the students could tell the difference between the skin hues this study was set up well and may not have been executed to its full potential.\nThe University is very diverse in students, however the researcher found mostly willing participants within the Hispanic community. Reasons for this could be the researchers is also Hispanic and unconsciously favored the areas that Hispanic students hang out at the most. There could also be more trust in the Hispanic community to work with another Hispanic student. This pilot study was done within one semester. If this study could have been drawn out over a whole school year it may have been much easier to not only have more participants but to also have more diverse participants. Another change that could be made to this experiment would be the demographics form, instead of only asking ethnicity, age, and sex, asking if they have ever been convicted of a crime should be added. Those that have committed crimes may have biases about sentencing that a non-criminal may have. The participants for this study were all undergraduate students, but if replicated this study could survey a sample population of different cities. \nOne of the concerns during this experiment was setting. The slideshow was done on a MacBook Air with the brightness turned all the way up, however, when outsides participants had to move the computer screen up or down to see it better or shift their seat to avoid the sun. Although participants did see a difference in Skin Hue further testing should have the slideshow only indoors. Other concerns on location was noise. One participant was viewing the slideshow in the Commuter House at Fresno Pacific University while other students were throwing a large stuffed dinosaur in the background while laughing loudly. This light-hearted mood and distracting objects being thrown could have changed the serious mood of the slideshow. This is one example of many where other students in the background were distracting. Allowing the slideshow to be shown anywhere helped the researcher get 72 participants in a decent amount of time, but it also opened the experiment to have many confounds."

While social distancing measures were necessary in order to protect the physical health of the population, it is questionable how it impacted individuals mental health during and after the pandemic. This study examines how those social distancing measures have impacted anxiety levels (general, separation, social anxiety) as well as the development of the theory of mind in young children (age 4-6) and if it has impacted children differently in different countries. The study was conducted in Heidelberg, Germany and Fresno, California and consisted of 39 child participants. To examine the anxiety levels the Preschool Parent Report Spence Anxiety Scale was handed to parents and the Sally-Anne Task was performed with each child to examine their theory of mind. The pandemic impacted the two populations differently since the American sample group had significantly higher social anxiety scores in comparison to the German sample group (p = 0.0369). This project discusses what differences could have led to the above difference."
