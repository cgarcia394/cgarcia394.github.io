<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods-section">Methods Section</h4>
<p>Given this background I hypothesize that college students will choose harsher punishment for a dark-skinned Hispanic man compared to a light-skinned Hispanic man. The question came about, how do I measure skin color and skin hue? Burch et al used light, medium, and dark as their measurement, but failed to provide pictures for reference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hannon and Defina in 2016 critic the scale as not completely accurate. They arrive at his conclusion by having people see a Latino and then try to identify their skin color using the scale. Most people answered Latino if what they saw fell between the pictures one through four. This experiment altered skin hues with Adobe Photoshop. The NIS Skin Hue scale was used because of its simplicity and because we did not need people to guess the skin tone, just see different skin tones presented for the same crime. There is no need for my participants to guess if the photo is a Latino or a Black man and these critics did not deem worth of dismissing the scale. For my experiment I decided to show participants a story of a crime, a picture of a Hispanic man who did the crime, and then ask them questions about how they would punish the criminal. This does however inspire a follow up question for participants. The follow up questions will be asking participants how dark they thought the picture was on a scale of one to ten.</p>
<p>Choosing the Hispanic community meant needing to find more articles about the Hispanic and Latino community in prison. Many studies I found when searching about skin color focused on Black Americans and prison sentences verses White Americans and prison sentences. Marrow et al in their article "Skin Tone and Mexicans' Perceptions of Discrimination in New Immigrant Destinations, 2022, focus on Mexican immigrants and discrimination. "Whiteness and citizenship affords greater protection to some lighter-skinned Latinos in new destination, while indigenous-origin and non-White or 'Brown' Latinos who 'look Mexican' or 'Hispanic' get left 'at the hands of immigration control'". In their study 62% of their participants, which was the majority of participants, identified as medium-skinned. This was important in identifying how I should present a representative of a Hispanic man in my experiment.</p>
<p>When trying to find a way to measure biases for skin color I needed to find a crime that did not evoke people to be so angry they would give a harsh sentence no matter what the criminal looked like, or a crime that would evoke people to not care about the crime at all. The United States Sentencing Commission had many facts about crimes and their average incarceration sentences. After looking through many offenses, robbery seemed to be a good middle ground. According to the 2015 fiscal year report 93.5% of robbery offenders were male. This solidified the decision to use a picture of a male in the experiment. The report also mentioned that 15.6% of these robberies were committed by Hispanics. The average sentencing for robbery in 2015 was 111 months (approximately 9.2 years).</p>
<p>After additional research it was decided that using a Hispanic man in my experiment with a medium skin tone, a three to six on the NIS scale, would be best to help me understand the biases of undergraduate students at Fresno Pacific University. Presenting the idea of a robbery would also benefit me when trying to see how harshly a Hispanic man would be punished. There are many studies on the data found in prisons when it comes to race and skin hue, this research hopes to further understand the biases people hold for the men who commit crime based on their skin hue</p>
<p><strong><em>Population</em></strong></p>
<p>A sample population of 72 participants was used for this experiment. Of the participants 42 were Hispanics and 29 were Non-Hispanics. Of the Non-Hispanics there was 1 African, 3 African-Americans, 6 Asians, and 19 White participants. A few of the participants answers were given in non-qualitative form and were not able to be used in the final results. Data collecting was not limited to the psychology lab due to concerns of participant numbers. A variety of candy was purchased from Walmart in hopes of giving participants an incentive to participate. Students on Fresno Pacific University's main campus were approached by the researcher introducing herself, major, and asking them if they'd like to participate in the experiment. Most said yes, but some said no with no reason given, and some said no because they had a test to study for/homework to do. Pens were also provided for the participants to make participating as convenient as possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Crime</em></strong></p>
<p>Quick Fact from the United State Sentencing Commission was used to determine that robbery would be used as the crime in the slideshow story. It is a common crime committed as well as most people are familiar with what robbery is. It also gave a general idea of what the average prison sentencing is: 111 months (about 9.25 calendar years).</p>
<p><strong><em>Skin Hue</em></strong></p>
<p>Hannon et al.&nbsp;critique the Massey and Martin's NIS Skin Color Scale, providing different shades of skin color represented in a picture of ten hands. While not pictured, albinism is represented by the number zero. This scale was easy to understand and publicly available for use.</p>
<p>Students who agreed to participate were given the consent form and demographics page. Once these were read, signed, and filled out they were asked to flip the demographics page over and use that to write down their answers to the questions on a sideshow. All the slides were plain white background and black text, except for the slide with a picture, that was plain white background and the picture. The plainness of the slideshow was to help the hypothesis by only emphasizes the mug shots as the only photos.</p>
<p>Slide one was just a plain slide with "Experiment" written on it. Slide two gave the story of a crime:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Hernandez has committed robbery. He walked into a convenience store Saturday night with a gun, pointed it at the 19-year-old cashier and demanded all the cash in the register. There were three other customers in the store at the time. He took the cash but was arrested soon after. In court, camera footage of him was used as evidence and he was convicted. You are the judge; how will you sentence him?</p>
<p>Slide three was a mugshot. Version 1 was a light-skinned man. Version 2 was a dark-sinned man. Slide four had the following questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>"On a scale of 1-10 how bad was this crime? 1 being not bad at all, 10 being very bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Between 1-20 years, how many years should Mr.&nbsp;Hernandez be face in jail?"&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Slide five was a follow up question hidden until the end for further research on this topic:</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“on a scale of 1-10 how dark skinned did you think the mug shot was?" (see figure 1)&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Participants were given a piece of candy after completing survey, if they didn't complete it they were still given a candy for their time.</p>
<p>I took three manilla envelopes and labeled them, "consent forms", "1", and "2". After their papers were given back to me, I would mark the back with either a 1 or a 2 depending on which version they completed, and then it was placed in the appropriate manilla envelope. I did not show the 1 or 2 marked envelopes to participants. I created an excel for all my data collection on my MacBook Air that is password protected. After compiling results, a poster board was made for presenting my research in person at Fresno Pacific University's research night and possible further presentation opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
