Using the NIS Skin Color Scale, the mug shot editing was chosen 2.5 shades darker than the original (left). The original mugshot was rated at a 3, and the photoshopped mugshot (right) at 5.5.

My brother Dr. Gabriel Garcia of the Univeristy of New Mexico was the model for the mugshots. Skin hue editing was done by [Andres Salazar Photography]()
